# personalspam
Puts some "personalized" spam in your gmail Drafts folder for sending.

## Usage
personalspam.py contacts.csv message.txt "subject line"

## Requirements
- Python 3
- The Google API, which is very very fun to [set up](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python)

## What it does
It takes your message in message.txt and prepares a draft for every contact in contacts.csv. Then you can review them in Gmail and send them all at once. File examples are in the repository.

## What it doesn't do
- Formatting
- Attachments
- Anything advanced

Cheers!
